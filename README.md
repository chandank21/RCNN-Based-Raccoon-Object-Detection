# RCNN-Based-Raccoon-Object-Detection
R-CNN Object Detection on Raccoon Dataset: This repository hosts our work on building an object detector for raccoons using R-CNN architecture. Discover how we leveraged OpenCV, Keras, and TensorFlow to achieve accurate and reliable raccoon detection in images

Welcome to the Raccoon Object Detection with R-CNN project repository. This project demonstrates the implementation of object detection using the R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network) approach on the raccoon dataset. The goal is to identify and locate raccoons within images.

## Project Overview

In this project, we leverage the power of computer vision and deep learning to develop an object detection model for raccoon images. We employ the R-CNN architecture, which combines selective search for region proposals and a convolutional neural network for object classification.

### Tools Used

- OpenCV: Image processing and region proposal generation.
- Keras: Neural network modeling.
- TensorFlow: Deep learning framework for training and inference.
